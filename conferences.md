# Jeff Zemerick's Conference Talks

I do consulting around the intersections of cloud, big-data, and NLP. The best way to reach me is through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffzemerick/).

## ApacheCon North America 2022
October 3-6, 2022 - New Orleans, LA<br>
Title: Apache OpenNLP 2.0: What's new and what's coming<br>
Technologies: OpenNLP (natural language processing tools and techniques)<br>

The first release of Apache OpenNLP was over 10 years ago. The NLP landscape has dramatically changed in the past few years with Python taking over as the dominant language for NLP applications. OpenNLP 2.0 introduces support for modern NLP architectures through ONNX models for entity recognition and document classification. We will show how Java applications, such as Apache Solr, can use these new capabilities in OpenNLP 2.0.  This talk will highlight OpenNLP’s journey, what’s new in version 2.0, and plans for future versions.

## OpenSearchCon 2022
September 21, 2022 - Seattle, WA<br>
Title: How Organizations can get the most out of their OpenSearch Contributions<br>
Technologies: OpenSearch, Open Source Contributions and Management<br>

With OpenSearch being available under the Apache license we are able to make use of it and its source code without cost. This provides organizations exciting possibilities to contribute and guide the project's future. But as an organization, how do you get the most benefit from your contributions? In this talk we'll describe a roadmap, common pitfalls, and key objectives organizations can follow to make sure their contributions to OpenSearch go beyond just committing code. This talk will be presented from personal experience from years active in various open source projects and from observations in the search industry.

## The Linux Foundation Open Source Summit 2022
June 24-24, 2022 - Austin, TX<br>
Title: [Searching for the Right Words: Bringing NLP to Apache solr through ONNX and OpenNLP](https://sched.co/11Nq2)<br>
Technologies: Apache OpenNLP, Apache Solr, ONNX Runtime<br>

Natural language processing capabilities have exploded in the past few years, with most of the work done in Python. The ONNX Runtime provides a means for using deep learning models across programming languages, architectures, and platforms, promising to further democratize advancements in machine learning. With the ONNX Runtime, developers no longer have to rely on remote services to access NLP services created in other languages. In this session we will show how a deep learning model trained using PyTorch or Tensorfow can be used for inference from a Java search stack of Apache OpenNLP, Apache Lucene, and Apache Solr. We will demonstrate how these state-of-the-art NLP capabilities can be realized in Apache Solr to offer search users a more impactful search experience. We will discuss the challenges, the relationships between OpenNLP, Lucene, and Solr, and how attendees can get started in these open source projects.

## Berlin Buzzwords 2021
June 17, 2021 - Virtual<br>
Title: [Applied MLOps to Maintain Model Freshness on Kubernetes](https://github.com/jzonthemtn/berlin-buzzwords-2021)<br>
Technologies: Containers, NLP, AI/ML, Kubernetes<br>

As machine learning becomes more pervasive across industries the need to automate the deployment of the required infrastructure becomes even more important. The ability to efficiently and automatically provision infrastructure for modeling training, evaluation, and serving becomes an important component of a successful ML pipeline. Combined with the ever growing popularity of Kubernetes, a full-cycle, containerized method for managing models is needed.

In this talk we will present a containerized architecture to handle the full machine learning lifecycle of an NLP model. We will describe our technologies and tools used along with our lessons learned along the way. We will show how models can be trained, evaluated, and served in an automated fashion with room for extensibility to be customized for specific workloads.

Attendees of this talk will come away with a working knowledge of how a machine learning pipeline can be constructed and managed inside Kubernetes. Knowledge of NLP is not required. All code presented will be available on GitHub.

## HashTalks 2021
February 18, 2021 - Virtual<br>
Title: From Training to Serving: Machine Learning Models with Terraform<br>
Technologies: Terraform, AWS, NLP, Containers

## Strata Data
September 2019 - New York, NY USA<br>
Title: [Protecting the Healthcare Enterprise from PHI Breaches using Streaming and NLP](https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-ny/public/schedule/detail/77249)<br>
Technologies: Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, NLP

## Activate Search and AI Conference
September 2019 - Washington, DC, USA<br>
Title: [Leveraging Neural Networks and Learning-to-Rank in Document Workflows](https://www.activate-conf.com/speakers/detail/jeff-zemerick)<br>
Technologies: NLP (document classification), Learning-to-Rank

## DataWorks Summit Washington DC
May 2019 - Washington, DC, USA<br>
Title: [Improving Organizational Knowledge with Natural Language Processing Enriched Data Pipelines](https://dataworkssummit.com/washington-dc-2019/session/improving-organizational-knowledge-with-natural-language-processing-enriched-data-pipelines/)<br>
Technologies: Apache NiFi, Apache Kafka, Apache OpenNLP, Apache Superset

## PyData Washington DC
November 2018 - McLean, Virginia, USA<br>
Title: [Using Sockeye Neural Machine Translation in a Streaming Pipeline](https://pydata.org/dc2018/schedule/presentation/23/)<br>
Technologies: Apache Flink, Sockeye<br>

Sockeye is a neural machine translation application written in Python and built on top of Apache MXNet. Apache Flink is a scalable streaming framework well-suited for handling large amounts of incoming text. In this talk we will present an overview of neural machine translation and an introduction to Sockeye and Flink. We will see how we can use Sockeye and Flink together to build a scalable streaming text translation pipeline. Developers will take away from this talk a better understanding of neural machine translation and have access to the code repositories to experiment with their own translation pipelines.

## Activate Search and AI Conference
October 2018 - Montreal, Quebec, Canada<br>
Title: [Embracing Diversity: Searching Over Multiple Languages](https://activate2018.sched.com/event/FkMf/embracing-diversity-searching-over-multiple-languages?iframe=yes&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=dark#)<br>
Technologies: Apache NiFi, Apache OpenNLP, Apache Solr, Sockeye<br>

Although a lot of online content is written in English there're tons of non English users out there that still need to retrieve information. When searching, especially for tech related topics, it's common to compose queries in English; however for such users search results written in their own native language may be preferred.

We'll see how statistical machine translation tools can help in the above scenario to perform text translation at query time, resulting in an improved recall and precision for the search engine queries.

We'll look at how cross language information retrieval can be implemented on top of Apache Solr with the help of a Neural machine translation toolkit and also leverage Pointer-Generator Networks to summarize the retrieved and translated results from different sources.

The audience will gain a better understanding of how to be able to make search queries against a multilingual corpora indexed into Apache Solr and being able to retrieve all of the relevant search results in different languages.

## Haystack Search Relevance Conference

Title: [Embracing Diversity: Implementing Multi-language Search](https://opensourceconnections.com/events/haystack-single/haystack-self-organizing/)<br>
Technologies: Apache NiFi, Apache Joshua, Elasticsearch
